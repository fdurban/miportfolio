                    Is Your Day is a Full Stack app developed in collaboration with my colleague Cristian Mausque.
                    Our idea was to create an app based on the same principle that students use to study, by making small paper cards where they summarize topics before an exam.
                    The first card contains the entire content of a topic,
                    while the subsequent cards have progressively less content to make it easier for students to memorize.

                    The app features a user interface that allows students to create their own profiles, design cards, save them,
                    and like cards created by other students, making the app more interactive and user-friendly. This was achieved by using technologies such as JavaScript,
                    React, and Bootstrap for the frontend, and Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT for the backend.

                    Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe App. The idea of this app wasnÂ´t other to practice React concepts that were complicated and hard to mnage while i was studying the Bootcamp.
                    The app is fully functional and available for players. Unfortunately it doesnt have any database other than the localStorage. The technologies used for this project were
                    mainly JS and React. Hope you enjoy it!

                        Welcome to my To-Do App. I developed this application together with my colleague Cristian Mausque immediately after completing the Web Development Bootcamp at IronHack.
                        This project served as a practical exercise to apply the concepts we had learned during the bootcamp, including user interface design,
                        session management, working with non-relational databases, and performing CRUD operations, among others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The To-Do App is a straightforward web application that enables users to manage their tasks within specific time periods. Users can register via email, create tasks, and access their personal information.
                        One of the main challenges we encountered during this project was implementing a smooth and efficient way for users to edit or delete tasks directly from the same interface where they created them.
                        This required a thorough review of React and presented a rewarding challenge.

                    </Button>

                </Modal.Header>
                <Modal.Body>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my first project as a freelance. In this case, me and my colleague Cristian are currently doing the website for the rebranding of Canasta productions.
                        The main challenge here was to create a better web application than the one they currently have. In this case, Canasta already had an UI work done that envolved the logo,
                        animations and other features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project is fully made with JavaScript and React for the user interface. Among all things left for the project there is the non-scrlling page view, make better interfaces
                        together with better color patterns and visualization of music videos (main product of Canasta)
                    </p>
